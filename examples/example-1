#
# FreeBSD server has two PPP links ppp0 and ppp1 with local IP addresses
# 10.100.10.10 and 10.200.20.20. IP Firewall is used on the server.
#
# It is needed to make IP accounting for each PPP link, but for
# the first link ppp0 we also should make separate IP accounting for
# incoming and outgoing traffic.
#
# There is special group "staff" which is responsible for IP accounting
# for interface ppp1, and users in this group should be allowed to view
# statistics for ppp1 link.
#

# Start all needed IP Firewall rules during IPA startup.
# This rules also can be started somewhere in external scripts.
# We could not specify local IP addresses in IP Firewall rules,
# but this helps to protect traffic accounting from
# "ping -S 127.0.0.1 remote.host.com" like commands.

# NOTE: it is better to put IP Firewall rules into one file and tell
# ipfw(8) to use it.

startup {
    exec = /sbin/ipfw 100 allow all from 10.100.10.10 to any via ppp0
    exec = /sbin/ipfw 200 allow all from any to 10.100.10.10 via ppp0
    exec = /sbin/ipfw 300 allow all from 10.200.20.20 to any via ppp1
    exec = /sbin/ipfw 300 allow all from any to 10.200.20.20 via ppp1
}

rule ppp0 {
    ipfw = 100 200
    info = Summary traffic for ppp0
}

rule ppp0_in {
    ipfw = 100
    info = Incomming traffic for ppp0
}

rule ppp0_out {
    ipfw = 200
    info = Outgoing traffic for ppp0
}

# There are two IP Firewall rules with the same number 300, they
# are distinguished by subnumbers.
