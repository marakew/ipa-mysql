  Good examples of configuration files are required.

  If you use IPA and think that your configuration file will be interesting
for all, please email it me. If you have time, please add comments to your
configuration file, it will help somebody. Include scripts, which set
FreeBSD IPv4/v6 Firewall, OpenBSD Packet Filter and/or IP Filter accounting
rules (if they are not set from the file ipa.conf of course) in your email
if it is possible.

Thanks.
