#
# FreeBSD server (with IP address 192.168.0.1 in our LAN) is connected to
# outside network. Clients 192.168.0.10-12 use our server as HTTP/FTP
# proxy server and one client 192.168.0.100 use our server as a gateway
# to outside network.
#
# It is needed to count traffic from (to) clients 192.168.0.10-12
# to (from) our proxy server 192.168.0.1:3128 and count traffic
# from (to) the client 192.168.0.100 to (from) outside network, except
# traffic passed by our router from (to) this client to (from)
# 10.1.2.0/24 network.
#
# The client 192.168.0.11 is not allowed to get more than 10 Mbytes
# per 2 hours and more that 20 Mbytes per day from the proxy server.
# If this client reaches first limit, it should be stopped for 1 hour
# and if it reaches second limit, it should be stopped until the end
# of current day.
#
# We want to see how many bytes the client 192.168.0.100 send (receive)
# to (from) outside network per hour. Also we want to change default
# database update time interval from 5 minutes to 1 minute and 30 seconds.
#

# Somewhere in a file we setup following IP Firewall
# rules for the client 192.168.0.100:
#
# add 1010 allow all from 192.168.0.100 to 10.1.2.0/24
# add 1020 allow all from 10.1.2.0/24 to 192.168.0.100
# add 1030 allow all from 192.168.0.100 to any
# add 1040 allow all from any to 192.168.0.100
#
# Somewhere in a file we setup following IP Firewall
# rules for clients 192.168.0.10-12:
#
# add 2000 count tcp from 192.168.0.10 to 192.168.0.1 3128
# add 2001 count tcp from 192.168.0.1 3128 to 192.168.0.10
# add 2010 count tcp from 192.168.0.11 to 192.168.0.1 3128
# add 2011 count tcp from 192.168.0.1 3128 to 192.168.0.11
# add 2020 count tcp from 192.168.0.12 to 192.168.0.1 3128
# add 2021 count tcp from 192.168.0.1 3128 to 192.168.0.12
#
# and add these IP Firewall rules to the system (using ipfw(8))

# Above shown IP Firewall rules we can add from the "startup"
# section (using ipfw(8)).
