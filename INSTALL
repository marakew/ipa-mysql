This version of IPA has been tested and run on following systems with
default FreeBSD IPv4/v6 Firewall, default OpenBSD Packet Filter and
default IP Filter version (by the author):

* FreeBSD/i386 4.8, 5.1
* NetBSD/i386 1.6
* OpenBSD/i386 3.3

Previous versions of IPA have been tested on following systems
(by the author):

* FreeBSD/i386 3.3, 3.4, 4.0-4.7, 5.0
* NetBSD/i386 1.5, 1.5.1
* OpenBSD/i386 2.7, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2

and this version is expected to run on them too.

There isn't any guarantee that you can build it and run on some other system.

To build and install IPA follows these steps (you can change some variables
in the Makefile if needed):

	1. download new version of IPA from:
		* http://ipa-system.sourceforge.net/

	2. unpack archive:
		# tar -zxvf ipa-x.x.x.tar.gz
		# cd ipa-x.x.x

	3. build it (see BUILD NOTES below):
		# make

	4. install it to /usr/local:
		# make install

	   or specify the prefix for destination directories:
		# make PREFIX=/some/dir install

To run IPA, you will need to (default paths are used, if you changed
default paths, then make the same steps but with your paths):

	1. read manual pages ipa(8), ipa.conf(5)

	2. add FreeBSD IPv4/v6 Firewall, OpenBSD Packet Filter and/or
	   IP Filter support into your kernel, if you haven't done this yet.

	3. customize the ipa.conf configuration file:
		# [your_favourite_editor] /usr/local/etc/ipa.conf

	4. rename the ipa.sh.sample shell script and run it:
		# cd /usr/local/etc/rc.d; mv ipa.sh.sample ipa.sh
		# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ipa.sh

	  or just run:
		# /usr/local/bin/ipa


* If you installed a kernel with new IPFW/IPF/PF implementation, then you
  should also rebuild IPA, because it uses IPFW/IPF/PF kernel structures
  (i.e. structures from some C-language header files) and they can be changed
  from one version of the operating system to another one, but see below.

* You should not rebuild IPA if you made changes in the kernel and those
  changes did not cause changes in IPFW/IPF/PF parts of the kernel.

* Here and everywhere in the IPA documentation "new kernel" or "new system"
  actually mean "new kernel" and "new system" and "new C-header files", that
  is if you installed new kernel, or new system, you should also install new
  C-header files (usually files in the /usr/include directory).

* You can check out for which system IPA was built
  by running:
	$ ipa -V

  and you will get something like this:
	IPA, version 1.1.3 (i386--FreeBSD 4.3-STABLE)
	Compiled on:
	   o Jun 15 2001, 23:49:13
	Support:
	   o IPv4 Firewall
	   o IPv6 Firewall
	   o IP Filter v3.4.16

To deinstall IPA from your system follow these steps:

	1. `cd' to its source directory and run:
		# make deinstall

	   or specify the prefix for destination directories:
		# make PREFIX=/some/dir deinstall

	2. remove database made by IPA (by default it is /var/ipa/)

	3. remove the configuration file and the shell script if you created
           them

BUILD NOTES
===========

It is possible to remove not needed accounting systems support from
IPA during compilation, use one or combination of following options for
the make(1) program:

-DWITHOUT_IPFW  -- remove FreeBSD IPv4 Firewall support (affect FreeBSD)
-DWITHOUT_IP6FW -- remove FreeBSD IPv6 Firewall support (affect FreeBSD>=4.2)
-DWITHOUT_PF    -- remove OpenBSD Packet Filter support (affect OpenBSD>=3.0)
-DWITHOUT_IPFIL -- remove IP Filter support (affect all systems)

If you want to use FreeBSD IPFW2 in IPA, then you can enable the IPFW2
support with the compile option -DIPFW2, but before this, check output
of the "ipa -V" command, may be IPFW2 is used by default on your system.

There were bugs in FreeBSD IPv6 Firewall implementation since FreeBSD
4.0-RELEASE (?) and IPA started to work correctly with IPv6 Firewall after
FreeBSD 4.2-RELEASE, when those bugs were fixed. Try to run "ipa -V", if
you do not see "IPv6 Firewall" in the output, but you know that your
FreeBSD has IPv6 Firewall support and your IPv6 Firewall does not have
kern/24248 bug, then you can enable IPv6 Firewall with the compile
option -DWITH_IP6FW

If you use FreeBSD or NetBSD with OpenBSD Packet Filter and want
IPA to work with it, then add the -DWITH_PF compile option.
If compilation failed, because some PF C-headers files weren't
found, then define the PF_INCLUDE_DIR=<directory> compile option,
where <directory> is the path to PF C-headers files (find that
directory before).
Example: make -DWITH_PF PF_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include/pf
